Welcome! I'm Amin G. Alhashim, also known as أمين غ. الهاشم in Arabic and Romanized as Ameen G. Al-Hashim. You can pronounce my name as [Amīn Alhashim](https://www.name-coach.com/amin-alhashim). Currently, I serve as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at Macalester College.

My passion lies in applied research, focusing on various aspects of the human experience.
