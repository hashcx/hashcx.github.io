Welcome! I'm Amin G. Alhashim, also known as أمين غ. الهاشم in Arabic and Romanized as Ameen G. Al-Hashim. You can pronounce my name as [Amīn (A-mee-n) al-HA-shim](https://www.name-coach.com/amin-alhashim). Currently, I serve as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at Macalester College.

My passion lies in applied research, focusing on various aspects of the human experience. Currently, my research centers around enhancing the learning experience and creativity of computer and data science students. I draw inspiration from fields such as computer science education, human factors, creativity research, [learning analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/), and [teaching as research](https://cirtl.net/teaching-as-research/).
